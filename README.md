# StackD

## About
StackD is an application developed to create a LAMP stack within a virtual machine. Using StackD will help streamline the installation process and set up of a LAMP stack on your machine in order to host your own webpages. This process can be confusing for first time users and could possibly save hours of time. All of the code needed to create this project on your own Mac is in contained within the top directory.

### Approach
A virtual machine is used in order to protect the Host OS. Many virtual instances can be spun up or torn down depending on the users needs. This approach allows for the the successful use of my code across multiple environments, leading to a more robust project.

#### Use

A path should be provided to the app and the installation will begin through bash scripts afterwards.
